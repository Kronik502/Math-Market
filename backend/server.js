Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'http' in 'C:\Users\eKasi_TMB_COM00725\Desktop\MATH MARKET\math-market\node_modules\follow-redirects'
Did you mean './http'?
Requests that should resolve in the current directory need to start with './'.
Requests that start with a name are treated as module requests and resolve within module directories (node_modules, C:\Users\eKasi_TMB_COM00725\Desktop\MATH MARKET\math-market\node_modules).
If changing the source code is not an option there is also a resolve options called 'preferRelative' which tries to resolve these kind of requests in the current directory too.

BREAKING CHANGE: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.
This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.

If you want to include a polyfill, you need to:
	- add a fallback 'resolve.fallback: { "http": require.resolve("stream-http") }'
	- install 'stream-http'
If you don't want to include a polyfill, you can use an empty module like this:
	resolve.fallback: { "http": false }
